            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The beauty and variety of Indian handloom is legendary. The texture and colour with the most intricate of woven patterns and embroidery can leave most anyone spellbound. As we celebrate India’s rich history of handlooms on National Handloom Day (August 7), let’s take a look at the checkered history of this celebrated craft that is still standing strong in the face of many challenges and delighting textile aficionados the world over.</p>
            <p>Archaeological evidence traces the beginning of handloom in the Indian sub-continent back to the Indus Valley Civilization. Subsequent Aryan settlers in the region also adopted and further honed techniques of weaving cotton and wool followed by embellishing these fabrics with dyes and embroidery. Spinning, weaving, dyeing and other textile related artforms gave rise to a flourishing cottage industry. The Indian handloom industry while being driven at a household level also found growing adoption across the world. Indian cotton and muslin fabrics were traded with the Roman Empire and Indian silk traded through China via the Silk Route to western countries. Indian textiles have been praised in several accounts by explorers and historians, from Megasthenes and Herodotus to Marco Polo.</p>

            <h2>Revenue</h1>
            <p>The Indian handloom industry today employs over 4.5 million people, both directly and indirectly, and is the second largest employer for rural India next only to agriculture. There are about 2.4 million looms of different kinds. The export of handloom products from India was valued at US$ 343.69 million in FY19. In FY19, the US was the major importer of Indian handloom products, with an estimated purchase of US$ 93.94 million, followed by the UK, Italy and Germany at US$ 17.77 million, US$ 16.47 and US$ 14.65 million, respectively. Nearly 15 per cent of cloth production in India is from the handloom sector. Production of hand-woven fabric from India constitutes 95 per cent of the global production. While the numbers seem impressive, the handloom sector is still plagued by problems. Low wages, rising costs, rise in power looms and proliferation of fakes are some of the issues that weavers have to contend with. New initiatives by the Textiles Ministry along with private entrepreneurship will hopefully help the Indian handloom industry regain its prominence.</p>
